# Department history

## A historical view

Jerzy Neyman came to the Department of Mathematics at Berkeley from University College, London, in 1938. He founded the Statistical Laboratory, which combined research with an extensive instructional program in Probability and Statistics. This program offered M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Statistics. In 1955 the Statistical Laboratory became the Department of Statistics with the following faculty: E. Barankin, David Blackwell, Evelyn Fix, J.L. Hodges, Charles H. Kraft, W. Kruskal, Lucien Le Cam, Erich Lehmann, Michel Loève, Jerzy Neyman (chair), Henry Scheffé and Elizabeth L. Scott.

From 1955 until 1981 the Statistical Laboratory functioned as a research unit under the direction of Jerzy Neyman. The Laboratory supported research in statistical theory and applications to such fields as astronomy, biology, communications theory, problems of health, and weather modification.

In 1981 Leo Breiman was appointed Director of the Statistical Laboratory. Under his direction the Departmental computer facilities greatly improved and expanded, and in 1986 the Statistical Computing Facility (SCF) was founded as a separate unit.

## The department now

The Department of Statistics offers higher degrees which emphasize theoretical or applied areas in probability and statistics. The Group in Biostatistics, which includes faculty from Public Health and Statistics, offers the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in biostatistics. This program is appropriate for people with strong interests in both statistics and the biological sciences.

The programs in statistics and biostatistics bring together students from diverse academic backgrounds. Currently there are around fifty Ph.D. and seventy M.A. students, and students in the department have come from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Italy, Israel, Korea, Russia, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam.

As well as being friendly toward international students, the department has been supportive of women since its inception, thanks in no small part to pioneers like Betty Scott and Evelyn Fix. The number of women on the faculty compares very favorably to other top-ranked departments.
