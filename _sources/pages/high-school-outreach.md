# High School Outreach

Part of the SGSA's mission is to broaden access to statistics and data science. One avenue through which we do so is by visiting local title 1 high schools to speak about careers in data science and pathways to higher education.

In the past, we have presented to pre-calculus, AP calculus, statistics, AP statistics, and AP physics classes. An example for what past presentations have looked like can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ddAaTLThTPKr17GHzAoDA_yyPfG4IrAoHXfm7jjBbkY/edit?usp=sharing).

If you are a teacher who would be interested in having us present in your classroom, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/T2bDL58F8FshLMj66).
