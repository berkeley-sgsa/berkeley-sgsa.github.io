# Internships

Internships are an excellent summer opportunity and are encouraged in the department. As of the 2024 fall survey, 7/20 responding students have done an internship at least once. 

Here are some reasons to consider an internship:

- It’s a nice break from your research that you’re working hard on during the rest of the year.
- It’s a good way to explore work culture outside of an academic setting.
- It can help you better figure out your research interests and your future career path.
