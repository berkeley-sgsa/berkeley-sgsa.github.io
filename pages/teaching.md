# Teaching

Students without external funding (e.g. fellowships, Graduate Student Researcher funding) typically receive funding through an appointment as a GSI (Graduate Student Instructor). GSI positions are generally appointed at 50% time, which generally corresponds to two sections of a single class or one section each of two classes (less common). Students who work as GSIs have their tutition, fees, and health insurance (via the UC Berkeley Student Health Insurance Plan) fully paid for by the department. GSIs also receive a monthly stipend to cover food, rent, and other living expenses. Regardless of funding, PhD students are required to GSI for at least 2 semesters during the course of their degree. The statistics department generally fully funds students for their first semester, so they don't have to worry about GSIing while making the transition to graduate school.

## GSI Responsibilities

A GSI functions as an assistant to the instructor for a course, so the work may be different for different courses. Typical GSI responsibilities include holding weekly or biweekly discussion/lab sections, holding office hours, regularly meeting with the instructor, and proctoring and grading exams. Some instructors require GSIs to help write homework or exams. GSIs for graduate classes may need to grade homework, whereas GSIs for undergraduate classes generally do not grade homework. The duties of a GSI with a 50% time appointment should not exceed 20 hours a week and may often be significantly less. Instructors will rarely assign all these duties and are generally very receptive to making adjustments if you find the GSI workload too heavy.

### Discussion Sections/Labs

Discussion sections are small class meetings led solely by the GSI. During discussion sections, GSIs usually work on example problems with students, answer student questions, and review material from the lectures. Some discussion sections are for students to do small coding projects related to the course material. Often, you can get materials from your instructor or previous GSIs of the course to help you plan out your discussion sections.

### Office Hours

50% GSIs generally hold 4 office hours a week, which are a time for students to ask questions on things like homework or concepts from lectures. Some instructors may have GSIs hold additional office hours in exchange of decreasing other responsibilities. The statistics department requires students to hold office hours in specified rooms (not your office) which are larger and can accommodate more students. GSIs are allowed to choose the timing of when they hold office hours, and, given instructor permission, may sometimes hold one or two remote office hours each week. Scheduling the time of your office hours is done via a shared Google spreadsheet that gets emailed to all GSIs.

### First-time GSI Responsibilities

First-time GSIs must attend a day-long GSI orientation hosted by the university and enroll in Stat 375, a pedagogy course designed to help you in your first time as a GSI. First-time GSIs may also need to fill out additional paperwork.

### GSIs for Graduate Courses

Graduate courses often do not have discussion sections. However, GSIs for graduate courses may responsible for grading homework.

### English Tests

## Summer Appointments

The department provides summer GSI appointments for any students who would like to make extra money over the summer. Unlike during the Fall and Spring semesters, students are allowed to GSI up to a 100% time appointment. Students who do not work as GSIs over the summer still receive insurance benefits, and working as a GSI over the summer is voluntary. Students may also sometimes have the opportunity to serve as an instructor for a summer course, rather than a GSI.

## Choosing your classes

Every semester, students fill out a survey about what classes they would like to GSI for. You might not get your top choice every semester, but you usually get close! If you really want to GSI for a specific course, you can talk to the instructor and see if they can request you as a GSI for the course.

## Union Membership

GSIs (and also Graduate Student Researchers) are automatically represented by a union, UAW 4811. Union membership is voluntary, but all students, regardless of union membership, receive the benefits of union contract negotiations.
