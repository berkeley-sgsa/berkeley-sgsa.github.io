# Fitness

Due to flexible hours and access to university facilities and programs, a PhD is a good opportunity to get in shape or stay in shape. Here are some ideas:

- **The gym**: Berkeley has a gym, the "Recreational Sports Facility" (RSF). It is relatively nice, but often crowded (especially the weight room). To learn which times are less crowded, see [here](https://aozerov.com/berkeley/weightroom). The RSF also has many different kinds of courts, a climbing wall, and a pool. The university has webpages showing what is open when, but you can also add [these calendars](https://aozerov.com/berkeley/calendar) to your google calendar.
- **Intramural leagues**: Berkeley offers semesterly [intramural leagues](https://recwell.berkeley.edu/competitive-programs/intramural-sports/registration-eligibility/) in many sports. Students from our department often play together!
- **Classes**: PhD students in our department can take any Berkeley classes, including [PE classes](https://pe.berkeley.edu/courses), for free (though some PE classes require a small equipment fee).
- **The Big Game**: every semester, at the Berkeley-Stanford Joint Colloquium, we play soccer together! Students and faculty are all invited to play.
- **Tennis**: Berkeley (the city) has a lot of nice tennis courts which can be used by anyone for free. They can also be reserved for a price. To save money, we have created [a page](https://aozerov.com/berkeley/tennis) showing which courts are not reserved and might be free today.
- **Club sports**: While your opportunity to be a D1 athlete is over, Berkeley (the university) allows graduate students play in club sports.
